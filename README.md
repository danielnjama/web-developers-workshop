python
Copy code
age = 25
name = "John"
Operators:

Operators perform operations on variables and values.
Examples:
python
Copy code
result = 10 + 5  # Addition
quotient = 20 / 4  # Division
Writing and Executing Code:
Setting Up a Development Environment:

Choose and set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Example IDEs: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse.
Writing Your First Code:

A simple "Hello, World!" program:
python
